A quick investigation using the almighty Google search engine told me that Tumblr could be it. Unfortunately, integrating with my own website learned that this platform didn't meet my requirements.

# Wordpress

Next one on my list was the famously known [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/). But on my first attempt to integrate this one, I got very annoyed by all the boilerplate that comes with this integration.

Wordpress introduces itself as something [very easy to setup](http://codex.wordpress.org/Integrating_Wordpress_with_Your_Website). But as you follow their docs step by step, you need to:

* download a bunch of files and include them in your project
* [set-up a mySql database](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress)

And on top of that..it's written in PHP! This reminds me at the old days.

All this frustration brought me back to the reality of 2015: isn't there a CMS which uses the latest technologies? I want a blog which runs on node.js and mongoDB! I cannot be the first one with this frustration!

# BAM!

That's the point that the almighty [Google Search Engine](https://www.google.be/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=blog+node.js+mongodb+cms) introduced me to [PencilBlue](https://pencilblue.org/)

A first investigation throughout the web gives me a first impression:

* Nice, modern look!
* Open source
* People seem to say that it's the modern version of Wordpress

For the sake of completeness, my google search didn't only mention PencilBlue. This very interesting [blogpost](http://y-designs.com/blog/node-cms-comparison-2015/) compares all Node-based CMS systems which were hot in 2015:

* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
* [Keystone](http://keystonejs.com/)
* [Apostrophe 2](http://www.easybird.be/en/blog/Apostrophe%202)
* [PencilBlue](https://pencilblue.org/)
* [Buckets.io](https://github.com/asm-products/buckets)

Buckets.io and Ghost look promising as well, but I'll check out PencilBlue!
